        <p> my name is ahmad, iam a 28 years old ,i live in amman ,I graduated from university in 2018, I was eager to
          find
          work to help myself and my family, but unfortunately I did not
          find and searched and searched a lot, but to no avail, I was forced to work in stores as a cashier and then I
          worked on
          my own car as a delivery driver until I found an advertisement from Luminous College to give courses In
          programming, I
          applied to join this course and was accepted into it, and I am now in the second phase of the course</p>
